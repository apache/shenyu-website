# Apache ShenYu Committer

## Self-Introduction

Hello everyone, I'm Musheng (shown), currently a Go/Java development engineer. I'm very excited to receive the invitation to become a Committer of the Apache ShenYu project. It's an honor to officially join as an Apache ShenYu Committer and contribute to the project's growth.

I've always been passionate about open source communities and am also a Committer for Apache Hertzbeat and a PMC member of the Spring AI Alibaba project.

## My Journey with Apache ShenYu

I've always had a strong interest in gateway projects. By chance, I met @Asia00 in the Apache Hertzbeat community. At that time, the ShenYu project was developing rapidly and had many "help wanted" and "good first issue" tags.

So I started submitting PRs to participate in the open source development of Apache ShenYu. After more than three months of continuous contributions, totaling 18k lines of code changes, I was nominated by @Asia00 and became a Committer.

## Experience Sharing

The journey of open source begins with interest and grows through practice. Open source is not only a carrier of technical enthusiasm, but also a journey of growing together with the community.

For developers participating in open source for the first time, being brave to try is the most important step. Even the smallest contribution can accumulate valuable experience. In daily work, actively participate in community discussions and code reviews, learning continuously through communication; maintain patience and persistence, as every challenge and difficulty encountered is an opportunity for growth.

In the Apache ShenYu community, there are many opportunities to actually participate in the project. Pay more attention to the Issue list and communicate more - there will always be someone actively responding to your ideas and getting inspired by your perspectives.

## Conclusion

I sincerely thank all community partners for their patient reviews and careful guidance. Becoming a Committer is just a small milestone for me. I look forward to continuing to uphold the spirit of open source with Apache ShenYu, attracting more excellent developers, and jointly building a technologically advanced and vibrant community. May the Apache ShenYu project soon reach 10k stars!
