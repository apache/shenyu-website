Then, I followed to ShenYu's public account driven by curiosity. After that, I learned that ShenYu not only has the characteristics of high-performance, multi-protocol, and scalability, but also provides various plug-ins that can be used out of the box. With the mentality of learning, I forked the source code of ShenYu on github. I was amazed by the richness of the documentations and the great detailed description of the technical details. so I subscribed to ShenYu's email according to the description of the document, and tried to participate in the construction of the community."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"my-way-to-open-source",children:"My way to Open source"}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["There was a time that the community organized a code cleaning event, aiming to clean and optimize the current shenyu code.

Fortunately, all of these were described in the ",(0,i.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://shenyu.apache.org/community/contributor-guide",children:"Contributor Guide"}),"  in great detail.

I found that the most time-consuming process of submitting a PR for local packaging was executing unit test cases. And I also found that there were still parts of the code that unit test code was not provided . Therefore, I decided to start participating in unit testing. First of all, I don't need to know too much source code since the tens of thousands of stock code in ShenYu is unable to be mastered in a day or two. In addition, results can be seen very quickly.

After several rounds of discussions in the email, my proposal was accepted and I became the leader of this task. In the process of doing this task, I divided it into many small tasks due to the large amount of test code involved, and several new friends were attracted  to join together.

At the same time, I received an invitation from the ShenYu community to officially become a committer. In my opinion, becoming an Apache committer is not only an honor, but also a responsibility.
