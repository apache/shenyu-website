## Apache Sign ICLA Guide {#apache-sign-icla-guide}

Apache CLA short for Apache Contributor License Agreement, the purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the ASF and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time.
A signed ICLA is required to be on file before an individual is given commit rights to any ASF project.

If you have already signed an Apache ICLA, no need to send an email. As you have already submitted an ICLA under your public name, no need to resubmit it. If you have never signed an ICLA, please indicate this in your email, and PMC can apply for this account directly.

The process of submitting ICLA are:

**1. First, click the link [Apache Licenses](https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas) and find CLAs under the Contributor License Agreements section.**

> - If you sign with a gpg signature, be sure that the email in the public key matches the email on the form
