href="https://github.com/lishuo5263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shuo Li</a> , java architect, currently engaged in  a big-sized Internet company,  It is my honor to be invited by the

In the early stage, I used SpringCloud Gateway + Nacos Config Event to realize the dynamic routing of gateway by myself. Because there was no dashboard of Gateway at that time, it was very painful. My team made a dashboard based on Micro Enterprise, which has a lot of functionality and limitations. From then on, I started to pursue a good gateway. One day, I found ShenYu, and saw that ShenYu&#x27;s overall architecture was in sharper contrast to SpringCloud Gateway. ShenYu outperforms Gateway in terms of overall architecture design, function design, plug-in design, etc. ShenYu can be said to be the next generation gateway product. After that, I started to have a certain understanding of Apache ShenYu from building environment to running example project, and then to read plug-in chain and data synchronization, SPI mechanism and other source code.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="start-submitting-pr"></a>Start submitting PR<a class="hash-link" href="#start-submitting-pr" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>It was not until January 2022 that I started to submit my first PR, which was to fix a problem that caused null Pointers when the Admin module started the default load instance. The function was small, but its significance was remarkable. It meant that I had a good start on the open source road from learning to contributing.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="ongoing-open-source-contributions-and-gains"></a>Ongoing open source contributions and gains<a class="hash-link" href="#ongoing-open-source-contributions-and-gains" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>So far, I have participated in the open source of Apache ShenYu community for more than half a year, contributing a lot and growing and harvesting a lot.

It named soul at that time. Since the business scenarios of the department required the use of a unified gateway, the main reason for choosing the shenyu gateway was that the plug-in design of shenyu was very suitable for the scenarios we needed. Functional plug-ins include divide, sentinel fuse, ratelimiter, protocol conversion of the company&#x27;s internal rpc, and log2Mongo, etc. With the continuous upgrade of shenyu version, we are also constantly upgrading our code.</p><p>When I read Shenyu&#x27;s code, I like most developers, had the following questions: What exactly is reactive programming? How to write reactive programming? How can shenyu&#x27;s code be written like this? With these questions, I read the source code of shenyu many times, and then debugged shenyu myself to see how shenyu handles requests and the specific logic of each plugin. During this period, I have also raised many issues in the shenyu community, thank the shenyu community for their help.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="my-opensource-experience"></a>My OpenSource experience<a class="hash-link" href="#my-opensource-experience" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The first time I submitted the code to shenyu was in March 2022. At that time, it was mainly found that the request body lost data when using rpc for protocol conversion, and then I found that the data was lost due to the rpc parameter conversion plugin, so I submitted my code to solve the bug of shenyu. </p><p>I contributed the following functions:</p><ul><li>springboot upgrade</li><li>refactor springcloud plugin</li><li>refactor cache plugin</li><li>refactor logging module and logging plugins.</li><li>refactor shenyu documents</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="thanks-to-the-community"></a>Thanks to the community<a class="hash-link" href="#thanks-to-the-community" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Special thanks to everyone who helped me (in no particular order):yu199195，qicz，li-keguo，dragon-zhang，renzhuyan，hutaishi，impactCn，yunlongn。</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="a-few-words-for-open-source-developers"></a>A few words for open source developers<a class="hash-link" href="#a-few-words-for-open-source-developers" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Open source development is actually a very meaningful and painful thing.

I am honored to be invited to be a Committer of Apache ShenYu community. As a business developer, I usually focus on business and then write CRUD, while participating in the open source of Apache ShenYu community gives me a different experience. More attention is paid to the code itself,  consider how to support various protocols, plug-in extensions, data synchronization, and more.  I would like to share with you my growth and suggestions during my participation in the Apache ShenYu community.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="meet-the-apache-shenyu-community-for-the-first-time"></a>Meet the Apache Shenyu community for the first time<a class="hash-link" href="#meet-the-apache-shenyu-community-for-the-first-time" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The story timeline has to go back to the end of 2020. At that time, in order to allow us to grow better, the department signed us up for the JAVA advanced training camp of Geek Time, that is, in this training camp, we were fortunate enough to get to know Mr. Cat. Under the leadership of Mr. Mao&#x27;s source code reading activity, I first came into contact with Apache Shenyu, which was not yet in the Apache incubator, and was also called Soul (hereinafter referred to as Apache Shenyu). The activity of reading the source code of Apache Shenyu lasted for three weeks in total. During the three weeks, we read the source code and blogged every day, from setting up the environment to running the example project, to reading the source code of the plug-in chain and data synchronization. Also have a certain understanding.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="start-submitting-pr"></a>Start submitting PR<a class="hash-link" href="#start-submitting-pr" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>In May 2021, I started to submit my first PR. At that time, I added a unit test to the Admin module. The function was small, but its significance was extraordinary, it meant that I started from learning to contributing, from playing to open source, which made a good start on the road of open source.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="ongoing-open-source-contributions-and-gains"></a>Ongoing open source contributions and gains<a class="hash-link" href="#ongoing-open-source-contributions-and-gains" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>So far, I have participated in the open source of Apache Shenyu community for more than a year, and I have made a lot of contributions and gained a lot of growth.  Details are as follows:</p><ul><li>Participated in soul&#x27;s migration to Apache Incubator and renamed Apache Shenyu.</li><li>Participate in the writing of unit tests for each module.</li><li>Responsible for integrating TarsResponsePlugin, GrpcResponsePlugin, SofaResponsePlugin, DubboResponsePlugin, etc. and refactoring them into ResponsePlugin for unified processing.</li><li>Responsible for Admin Oracle database support.</li><li>Responsible for the support of Shenyu gateway instance registration to Consul.</li><li>Participated in the repair of some found problems, sample project writing, JAR package replacement and upgrade, integration test writing, etc.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="thanks-to-the-community"></a>Thanks to the community<a class="hash-link" href="#thanks-to-the-community" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Thanks to my friends who helped me or inspired me for free (in no particular order): yu199195，dragon-zhang，li-keguo，qicz，moremind，zouchangfu，lianjunwei</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="a-little-advice-for-newcomers"></a>A little advice for newcomers<a class="hash-link" href="#a-little-advice-for-newcomers" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Apache Way has a philosophy: community is greater than code, and we firmly believe that a healthy community is more important than good code. After more than a year of participation, I also felt that Apache Shenyu community has put this into practice very well, such as bi-weekly meetings, consensual voluntary tasks, open and transparent community, and enthusiastic help from partners.  So today I will also give this sentence to newcomers. The community is bigger than the code.

The first task I received was to familiarize myself with the company&#x27;s gateway middleware as soon as possible. So a gateway called Soul entered my field of vision (Soul is the predecessor of ShenYu, ShenYu entered the Apache incubator in 2021, the following Soul/ShenYu refers to Apache ShenYu(incubating) ).</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="acquaintance"></a>Acquaintance<a class="hash-link" href="#acquaintance" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>After about a week of study, I have a certain degree of understanding of the code of Soul. In the following 2-3 months, as I continued to help the company&#x27;s business developer to answer and solve problems, I gradually discovered some parts of the Soul that were not ergonomic.</p><p>Until December 2021, out of company needs and personal interests, I started to investigate ShenYu and consider an upgrade plan, and then I really started to contact ShenYu and the community.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="understanding"></a>Understanding<a class="hash-link" href="#understanding" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>ShenYu is an asynchronous, high-performance, cross-language, and responsive API gateway. It adheres to the design concept of plugin and full-link asynchronous. At present, many plugins have been integrated for users to choose.

id="contact-open-source"></a>Contact Open Source<a class="hash-link" href="#contact-open-source" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>In the second semester of my sophomore year, by chance, I saw the promotion of the Open Source Software Supply Chain Lighting Program (hereinafter referred to as the Summer of Open Source) organized by the Institute of Software of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the openEuler community. Later, I slowly learned that there were so many people active in the open source community in China, which greatly promoted the development of the open source ecosystem. It was also a very coincidence that I met the VP (Xiao Yu) of Apache ShenYu, who was my mentor in the Apache ShardingSphere community during the summer of open source. After I completed the task of open source summer ahead of schedule, I saw that ShenYu had just entered the Apache incubator, and it was in full swing, so I started to contact Apache ShenYu.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="grow-in-the-community"></a>Grow In The Community<a class="hash-link" href="#grow-in-the-community" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>My earliest contribution to ShenYu was not code, but documentation. At that time, I found a few typo on the official website, so I decisively submitted a pr and  become ShenYu&#x27;s Contributor.</p><p>Later, after participating in the regular meeting of the community, I found that ShenYu, as an Apache incubator project, actually still has many places to be optimized and enriched. So, I started with integration testing and started the journey of fighting monsters and upgrading.</p><p>In fact, there are a lot of things that can be learned by doing integration testing, from Docker, CI to ShenYu&#x27;s functional implementation details, microservice ecology and so on. Sometimes inappropriateness of the official website documentation is found during testing, so you need to read the source code yourself, understand the code logic, and then improve or correct the documentation; sometimes some bugs are found, so you can be familiar with ShenYu gateway in locating bugs and fixing bugs details. Later, you can gradually implement some new features yourself.</p><p>While getting familiar with the ShenYu project, the sense of awe for ShenYu is also getting higher and higher. Design patterns, asynchronous programming, functional programming, etc. in ShenYu are all very ingenious and worth learning.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="harvest-in-open-source"></a>Harvest In Open Source<a class="hash-link" href="#harvest-in-open-source" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Looking back on the past six months since I participated in open source, I feel that I have gained a lot, which is mainly reflected in the following aspects.</p><ol><li><p>Improvement of technical level. Participating in open source can not only get in touch with a lot of knowledge that cannot be learned in school, but also can see the practical scene of &quot;slaying dragon martial arts&quot; that I have learned. As an API gateway, Apache ShenYu is the entrance to the entire microservice system. While participating in the project construction, you will naturally be exposed to various knowledge in the field of microservices.</p></li><li><p>Broaden the horizons. Personally experiencing the discussion of the new feature of the project and participating in activities such as ApacheCon and the Open Source Annual Conference have enabled me to have a more systematic understanding and thinking about the microservice ecology and development trends.</p></li><li><p>Help with job interviews. The addition of open source experience on my resume has really helped me in my interview for an internship, and it has also been affirmed by the interviewer.</p></li></ol><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="some-advice-for-newcomers"></a>Some Advice For Newcomers<a class="hash-link" href="#some-advice-for-newcomers" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ol><li><p>Adapt to asynchronous communication. Different from our usual communication methods, the open source community often uses asynchronous communication methods, such as mailing lists, GitHub issues, Jira, etc. The priority of the communication methods recommended by the Apache ShenYu community is: mailing list &gt; Github issue &gt; WeChat group . This is because through the mailing list and github, the discussion process and results of the issue can be retained, which is open and transparent. On the other hand, throwing questions on the mailing list is often the quickest and most effective solution.</p></li><li><p>Actively participate in discussions. Community trumps code, this is what the Apache Way advocates. The code obtained through full communication and discussion is more vibrant. In addition, the Apache ShenYu community will hold an online regular meeting every two weeks, which will periodically summarize the work of the community, as well as the goals and tasks after the discussion (and will also be posted to the mailing list).</p></li><li><p>How to contribute? The first is after the above-mentioned discussion, and then the hands-on. For those who have not applied ShenYu in their work, writing integration tests and source code analysis articles is a very good entry point. At the same time, the Apache ShenYu community often publishes a lot of easy or difficult tasks, and we all look forward to your participation.</p></li><li><p>Advice for current students who want to get involved in open source but haven&#x27;t done it yet. Participate in open source boldly. Among the several open source communities I have come into contact with, students are more friendly, expectant and tolerant. In addition, some organizations will hold activities to guide student groups to participate in open source, such as Open Source Summer (mentioned above), GSoC (Google Summer of Programming), etc., which are also very good ways to participate, not only will there be generous bonuses, but also Get to know a lot of friends and tech giants.</p></li></ol></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/news/tags/apache-shen-yu">Apache ShenYu</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_d4p0"><a href="/news/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-2021-11-11">[From users to Committer, different experiences and gains]</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_-Im+ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-11-11T00:00:00.000Z">November 11, 2021</time> · 5 min read</div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><div class="avatar__intro"><div class="avatar__name"><a>qicz</a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle"></small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="new-committer-introduction"></a>New Committer Introduction<a class="hash-link" href="#new-committer-introduction" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Hello everyone, my name is qicz, and I am very honored to be invited by the Apache ShenYu community to become Apache ShenYu Committer. I am a &quot;unknown&quot; programmer. Miscellaneous, because I was also a part of entrepreneurship that year and that month. At that time, I often had to choose a different programming language to practice miscellaneous. In the process, there were more opportunities to learn about and contact many varieties of projects. . I am also an open source enthusiast, and I like &quot;playing with code&quot;, so I often find myself in the open source community. I have always been adhering to the concept of open source and have worked on several open source projects. There are often many fun and interesting open source projects in the community, and Apache ShenYu is one of them. Next, I will briefly share with you my feelings during the time I participated in the Apache ShenYu community。</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="mental-journey"></a>Mental journey<a class="hash-link" href="#mental-journey" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>​	I learned that Soul is a very early time. The official contact with Apache ShenYu was in September of this year. At that time, I just received the company&#x27;s gateway demand, and it took a short time to master and produce something.</p><p>​	For gateway projects, there have been studies before, such as Spring Gateway, Kong, etc. After this period of research and continuous participation in the Apache ShenYu project, I am very satisfied with its design concept-plug-in, everything is done based on plug-ins. Although gateways like Kong also support plug-ins, lua is really not fun. The other is that Apache ShenYu&#x27;s documentation is also very rich, explaining the core design and the principles of some plug-ins in a very detailed manner. Apache ShenYu is implemented in Java. As a no-brand designer, I am still very porridge. But despite this, it is really painful to study it. The first time I saw the source code of Apache ShenYu, it was very big, and the modules were divided into many details.</p><p>Everything is difficult at the beginning, and it may be smooth if you have a good beginning. My beginning was about the processing of crossfilter, and put the configuration written in the code into the external configuration file. Looking back on the process of submitting pr for the first time, it was really boring, and I still feel too painful until now.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="provide-pull-request"></a>Provide Pull Request<a class="hash-link" href="#provide-pull-request" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>​	  First of all, all issues, prs, and emails must be in English. I haven&#x27;t written things in English for some time. Many times I have written by myself. I can&#x27;t believe and determine if there is a problem with what I wrote. It is estimated that many times I have done Chinese English. However, based on my many years of entrepreneurial experience, everything is a paper tiger. In many cases, as long as I keep on doing it, it will get better and better. Up to now, the constant use of English to organize all kinds of things has become more and more comfortable. Happy! Beautiful! Wonderful!</p><p>​	Another, every time you submit the checkstyle and test of pr, it is also very boring. Because the source code has very strict specifications, from comments to line breaks to punctuation. I have been in contact with programming since I was in college. Because the instructor asked us to pay attention to the coding style, we have strictly required our own coding until today, and constantly practiced my code cleanliness skills. I think my coding is very standardized, but I was really defeated in the first pr. On the one hand, the process is not very clear. On the other hand, because of the large number of modules, the local package checkstyle is very slow, and many problems require a complete package process to be exposed. I remember the longest time since it took almost 2 hours.</p><p>This process is really too painful. But after many attempts, the first pr succeeded. The difficult beginning is over. But from a personal point of view, it is very supportive and agreeable. If there is no such meticulous requirement, how can we better build this project and community, and use this as a basis to help and serve more small partners.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="community-and-company-integration"></a>Community and company integration<a class="hash-link" href="#community-and-company-integration" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>​	In the process of continuously matching the company&#x27;s needs, the research on Apache ShenYu is also constantly deepening. I started to do some customized development. In the process, other bugs were constantly discovered, so there were second, third and more prs. In this process, many times are completed on weekends or staying up late. It is really tiring, but it is still very fulfilling. Especially when my own PR solves the actual needs and is recognized by the community at the same time, it is really an achievement. Feeling full.</p><p>​	With the passage of time, I now have a deep understanding of Apache ShenYu. In the future, I will do my best to devote my spare time to the construction of the community and gather actual needs, regardless of the design and development of various features. Adhere to the original intention of open source-from the community to give back to the community, make more contributions to the community, and grow together with the community.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/news/tags/apache-shen-yu">Apache ShenYu</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_d4p0"><a href="/news/Apache-ShenYu-PPMC-2021-11-05">[Apache ShenYu(incubating) newly promoted PPMC]</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_-Im+ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-11-05T00:00:00.000Z">November 5, 2021</time> · 2 min read</div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><div class="avatar__intro"><div class="avatar__name"><a>Liu Liang</a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle"></small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="introduction-of-new-ppmc"></a>Introduction of new PPMC<a class="hash-link" href="#introduction-of-new-ppmc" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li><p>CMB Network Technology Software Development Engineer.</p></li><li><p>GithubID: midnight2104.</p></li><li><p>Email: <a href="mailto:midnight2104@apache.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">midnight2104@apache.org</a></p></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="community-contribution"></a>Community Contribution<a class="hash-link" href="#community-contribution" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li><p>Deeply involved in the development of <code>Apache ShenYu</code> plug-in system (<code>GRPC</code> plugin, etc.).</p></li><li><p>Practice the <code>Apache Way</code>, be active in the community, help others, and actively participate in source code activities and official website documentation construction.</p></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="community-experience"></a>Community Experience<a class="hash-link" href="#community-experience" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li><p>Community over code: Creating a good community atmosphere is important, more important than writing code.

ShenYu has high-performance, multi-protocol, easy to expand, and reactive features, and has provided a variety of plug-ins, out-of-the-box, very potential, I try to learn it.</p><p>  In addition to the official documents, ShenYu also has source code analysis provided by many community partners, so you can quickly understand the implementation principle on the basis of rapid use. The community is very active, everyone actively reports and fixes bugs encountered, discusses new ideas together, and helps new friends integrate into the community. For the problems encountered in the first use, if you raise an issue or consult in the community exchange area, friends in the community will actively answer your doubts. These documents and community friends helped me quickly get started with the ShenYu gateway, and also made me feel the friendly and positive atmosphere of the ShenYu community.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="open-source-is-not-far-away"></a>Open source is not far away<a class="hash-link" href="#open-source-is-not-far-away" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>  When I first read the source code of ShenYu, I saw that the code was a bit redundant and could be streamlined. Based on this, I wanted to create an issue, and worried that the optimization was too small to be accepted by the community. After tangled up, I still created an issue based on the previous issue format to express my thoughts. After a short while, I received feedback from the community, encouraging me to submit a PR to optimize this code. I followed the community&#x27;s contribution guide and completed this small optimization step by step. The new PR was quickly merged and I saw myself in the Contributor list. This is the transition from ordinary users to contributor. Although it is simple, it motivates me a lot and makes me feel that open source is not far away.</p><p>  After that, I became more and more familiar with ShenYu&#x27;s code, and the relationship between the various modules was gradually sorted out. And I learned a lot of elegant design ideas from the project. During the period, I occasionally found some bugs, code and functions that can be optimized. I took the initiative to put forward issues to fix and improve these problems. The Committer of the community will review the code very carefully every time and give some suggestions for improvement. Later, I also participated in the construction of the official website of the community, writing and improving documents.</p><p>  The ShenYu community is open and inclusive. Some tasks are often released, and many of them are suitable for novices. In fact, they are to help more people integrate into the community. You can follow the community mail, issue, WeChat group, etc. to receive tasks, have a goal to complete, and get familiar with the project faster. At the same time, the community has an open weekly meeting, everyone can participate in, and you can understand the current function development progress of ShenYu, and the community&#x27;s planning.</p><p>  After becoming Committer, in addition to continuing to follow up on issues in the community, I will also actively think about and participate in the development of some new features, and strive to make more contributions to the community and grow together with the community.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="some-suggestions-for-newcomers"></a>Some suggestions for newcomers<a class="hash-link" href="#some-suggestions-for-newcomers" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>  For those who want to participate in open source, here are some small suggestions:</p><ul><li><p>Starting from the official documentation, first use the main functions of the project to have an overall understanding. Then refer to some source code analysis articles in the community to understand the details of the internal implementation. There may be some small difficulties at the beginning. You can start with a simple small issue and gradually participate in the contribution of the community.</p></li><li><p>Boldly put forward your ideas, whether it is code structure, new functions, or questions about use, you can raise them. The form of contribution is not limited to code, but also includes documentation, active participation in feature discussions, helping other friends to answer questions, and so on.</p></li><li><p>Actively pay attention to the community, receive the tasks released by the community, and communicate with other people in the community if you have any questions about the implementation.</p></li></ul></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/news/tags/apache-shen-yu">Apache ShenYu</a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/news"><div class="pagination-nav__label">« Newer Entries</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/news/page/3"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries »</div></a></div></nav></main></div></div></div></div>
