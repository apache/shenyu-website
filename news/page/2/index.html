class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="introduction-of-new-committer"></a>Introduction of new Committer<a class="hash-link" href="#introduction-of-new-committer" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Hello, everyone. My name is Liu Liang. I am working as a software development engineer in China Merchants Network Technology Co., LTD. It is my great honor to receive the invitation of Apache ShenYu community to become a Committer of Apache ShenYu. Now I would like to share with you my growth and suggestions during my participation in Apache ShenYu community.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="know-open-source"></a>Know Open Source<a class="hash-link" href="#know-open-source" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>After graduation last year, I feel that my skills are far from enough, so I am constantly learning. Along the way, one of the teachers offered the opportunity to participate in an open source project. I started with the idea that working on open source projects would improve my skills and help me get a job.</p><p>The open source project involved is Apache ShenYu(Incubating), which is an asynchronous, high-performance, cross-language, responsive API gateway. In the community communication group, there are many active students who actively discuss issues and consciously find bugs.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="participate-in-the-open-source"></a>Participate in the open source<a class="hash-link" href="#participate-in-the-open-source" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>My first task was to add test cases. Tasks are usually posted as an issue, and if you&#x27;re interested, reply under the issue. Fortunately, the official community provides an action document that simply follows the steps above, mainly forking the project into its repository, pulling it locally, creating the corresponding issue branch locally, and then actually writing code.</p><p>The first task is to write unit tests for the entity class. The solution is to call the get/set method via reflection, and when you&#x27;re done, submit your code and merge it. This was my first PR contribution to an open source project, and I&#x27;ve been a contributor to open source projects ever since, hahaha.</p><p>Then I did other tasks. The second time, I looked back at the code I submitted the first time and found it was different from the one I submitted. I checked the git submission record and found that my code was committer refactored. I took a close look at my code and the refactored code and said, &quot;Well, this is a more elegant way to write it.</p><p>In continuing to be involved, I&#x27;ve gained a deeper understanding of Apache ShenYu(Incubator) projects and a greater understanding of the open source culture.</p><p>Apache ShenYu(Incubating) committers can often publish tasks through mail, issues, and community groups. I noticed that there was a feature on gRPC optimization that no one had done yet, and was ready to take it on. However, I still remember hesitating for a long time at that time. I don&#x27;t know what to do with this feature. Can I handle it? GRPC is not used, I can also go to optimize? In constant doubt and denial...... This function is a core part of the project, so it&#x27;s a rare opportunity. Why not try it first? Finally, I took a step to complete the task.</p><p>The next step is how to solve this problem. This is a very specific technical problem, I will not expand, mainly about their feelings. When you encounter a problem, you should first analyze what the specific problem is, where to start to solve it, why the existing solution does not work, and what results to achieve in the end, and communicate with others more. I&#x27;ve also been in constant communication with Apache ShenYu(Incubating) PPMC while I&#x27;ve been working on this issue, to discuss whether my solution is feasible. In the process of research and analysis, I have always backed down, because this problem is not easy for me to do. But PPMC in Apache ShenYu(Incubator) has been encouraging me: There&#x27;s no time limit on this, you can take your time and talk to others about it. In this way, step by step, constantly consult, finally solved the problem, the submitted code was successfully merged by the project.</p><p>And then later, you started in Apache ShenYu(Incubator weekly meetings) to learn what other people are doing, learn about incubating, and learn more about open source culture. I also contributed more to Apache ShenYu(Incubating) in its own website.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="experience-in-the-apache-shenyuincubating-community"></a>Experience in the Apache ShenYu(Incubating) community<a class="hash-link" href="#experience-in-the-apache-shenyuincubating-community" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>I have been talking about my open source experience in the past. In fact, this is my true inner activity and a process of growth. Since you&#x27;ve been in open source, you&#x27;ve slowly felt more open source charm, and the Apache ShenYu(Incubating) community is in a good mood.</p><ul><li><p>Community over Code: Building a good community is more important than writing code. The Apache ShenYu(Incubator) community is also working to improve, to get new users in and lower the threshold where possible;</p></li><li><p>Transparent and open decision making: community development, feature development, and user issues are made public and archived in mailing lists;</p></li><li><p>Equality and respect: focus on the communication of technical community, your contribution determines your authority;</p></li><li><p>Broaden vision: not satisfied with CRUD in daily work, participate in open source, your code will be reviewed, see what is good code, learn more about open source projects, improve personal technical ability;</p></li><li><p>No size of contribution: Whether you complete a core feature, write a test case, build a website, modify documentation, these contributions are the same and will be recognized by the community.</p></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="a-little-advice-for-the-new-guy"></a>A little advice for the new guy<a class="hash-link" href="#a-little-advice-for-the-new-guy" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>If you have friends who are interested in open source, but have not participated in it yet, do you have these problems?</p><ul><li><p>If you ask too simple questions, do you seem incompetent? No, people are well prepared for technical discussions, their own questions, have more background information, and the community is happy to respond to you and answer your questions.</p></li><li><p>Newcomers don&#x27;t know how to participate? The community provides documentation, follows through, and can participate. There are also novice missions that can be directly participated in.</p></li><li><p>No time? The development of the community is personal investment, no commercial interests, members are free time to participate in it, I believe you can also.</p></li><li><p>Too difficult to solve? Talk to people in your community. That&#x27;s how you develop your skills.</p></li></ul></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/news/tags/apache-shen-yu">Apache ShenYu</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_d4p0"><a href="/news/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-2022-02-28">[The Open Source Path for Tech Veterans]</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_-Im+ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-02-28T00:00:00.000Z">February 28, 2021</time> · 6 min read</div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><div class="avatar__intro"><div class="avatar__name"><a>Haibo Duan</a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle"></small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="self-introduction"></a>Self Introduction:<a class="hash-link" href="#self-introduction" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Hello everyone, my name is Duan Haibo, my github account is <a href="https://github.com/haibo-duan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haibo-duan</a>. It is my honor to be invited by the Apache ShenYu community as the Committer. Here, I would like to share with you my growth and advice from participating in the Apache ShenYu community.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="getting-to-know-apache-shenyu"></a>Getting to know Apache ShenYu<a class="hash-link" href="#getting-to-know-apache-shenyu" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>In the last year&#x27;s source code reading activity, Tt was my first time to hear about the Soul Gateway of the Dromara open source community officially joined the Apache Foundation incubator and renamed to ShenYu. Since ShenYu is the first open source project which named by Chinese traditional culture, which attracted me a lot since naming a procject can be frustrating for a programmer. Then, I followed to ShenYu&#x27;s public account driven by curiosity. After that, I learned that ShenYu not only has the characteristics of high-performance, multi-protocol, and scalability, but also provides various plug-ins that can be used out of the box. With the mentality of learning, I forked the source code of ShenYu on github. I was amazed by the richness of the documentations and the great detailed description of the technical details. so I subscribed to ShenYu&#x27;s email according to the description of the document, and tried to participate in the construction of the community.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="my-way-to-open-source"></a>My way to Open source<a class="hash-link" href="#my-way-to-open-source" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>There was a time that the community organized a code cleaning event, aiming to clean and optimize the current shenyu code. I took a look at the requirements of this task which was not difficult, so I optimized some codes according to the specification with the mentality of giving it a try, and then submitted the first PR. Everything is difficult at the beginning. There were a lot of things to learn in the first PR, including the format of PR, the branch of code, and the submission process. Fortunately, all of these were described in the <a href="https://shenyu.apache.org/en/community/contributor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contributor Guide</a>  in great detail. What impressed me the most was ShenYu&#x27;s checkstyle, which was very strict to the specification, including comments and spaces. Although I had paid a lot of attention to code specifications, there was still a little difficult for me to use this checkstyle at the beginning. However, I got used to this process soon, since the code after unified checkstyle let me feel extremely comfortable.</p><p>After the first PR from 0 to 1, the subsequent process was much easier. I found that the most time-consuming process of submitting a PR for local packaging was executing unit test cases. And I also found that there were still parts of the code that unit test code was not provided . Therefore, I decided to start participating in unit testing. First of all, I don&#x27;t need to know too much source code since the tens of thousands of stock code in ShenYu is unable to be mastered in a day or two. In addition, results can be seen very quickly. In the process of writing unit test cases, I can not only find bugs in the source code to improve the code quality, but also understand the source code better.</p><p>At this time, some problems at work also required me to investigate the unit testing technology. When I learned about the new features of junit5, I found unit4 was used in Shenyu , so I sent an email to ask the ShenYu community if an upgrade was possible. After several rounds of discussions in the email, my proposal was accepted and I became the leader of this task. In the process of doing this task, I divided it into many small tasks due to the large amount of test code involved, and several new friends were attracted  to join together. In addition, in the task of this junit5 upgrade, it was also found that PowerMock was used in many previous use cases, which had a problem in the compatibility of the new version of jdk. So PowerMock had also been removed.</p><p>The ShenYu community is open and inclusive. After completing these tasks, I am very familiar with ShenYu&#x27;s functional modules. In addition to continuing to follow up some issues in the community, I can also think more based on my own work experience, and propose some questions and ideas in the weekly meeting. At the same time, I received an invitation from the ShenYu community to officially become a committer. In my opinion, becoming an Apache committer is not only an honor, but also a responsibility. Being trusted by the community, I need to contribute more to the community then. Becoming an Apache committer is not the end, but just a higher beginning.</p><header><h1 class="h1Heading_dC7a">My experience in Apahce ShenYu Community</h1></header><p>In the process of participating in open source during this time, I have gained a lot, following are some of my experiences for your reference:</p><ul><li><p>Start small: Contributions to the open source community are regardless of size. It&#x27;s a contribution to the community no matter it&#x27;s a major feature improvement or an one-line documentation error. Therefore,do not miss doing any good thing no matter how insignificant it looks. As long as it is a valuable contribution, it&#x27;s welcomed by the community.</p></li><li><p>Active participation and continuous contribution:  Open source is a process of accumulating sand and building a tower. One time contribution may be limited, but as long as you participate in community activities actively, you can get promotion, no matter a proposal discussion in the email or the review code. You may not be as committed as you are in work, but as long as you make good use of your spare time and persist for a long time, you can still be successful.</p></li><li><p>Participate in email discussions and put forward ideas boldly: The biggest characteristics of open source communities are democracy, openness and transparency. Here, any ideas and suggestions will be fully valued. If you have a great idea, you just need to send an email and you can discuss it with everyone in the community. Your emails will always be answered. And all discussions are public, you can see people&#x27;s discussions about your question. In many cases, the process of discussing about the problem is often more valuable than solving the problem itself.</p></li></ul></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/news/tags/apache-shen-yu">Apache ShenYu</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_d4p0"><a href="/news/Soul-gateway-release-milestone-version-2.3.0">【Soul gateway release milestone version 2.3.0】New support for grpc, tars and sofa protocols!</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_-Im+ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-07-05T00:00:00.000Z">July 5, 2020</time> · 4 min read</div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><div class="avatar__intro"><div class="avatar__name"><a>xiaoyu</a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle"></small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>It&#x27;s half a year since the last release.
