# PMC Member Responsibilities

## Developing New Submitters

Developing committers is one of the most important functions of any PMC, and PMC members need to guide contributors to contribute smoothly, monitor their contribution volume, and nominate contributors as committers when appropriate.

## Participate in community activities

This includes but is not limited to answering questions, giving talks, promoting projects, maintaining the brand, etc.

## Release and version checking

PMC members should actively become release managers to release new releases. If you are not a release manager, you should do release checking when a new release is under publishing.
