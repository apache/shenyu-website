I am a "unknown" programmer. Miscellaneous, because I was also a part of entrepreneurship that year and that month. At that time, I often had to choose a different programming language to practice miscellaneous. In the process, there were more opportunities to learn about and contact many varieties of projects. . I am also an open source enthusiast, and I like "playing with code", so I often find myself in the open source community. I have always been adhering to the concept of open source and have worked on several open source projects.

Although gateways like Kong also support plug-ins, lua is really not fun. The other is that Apache ShenYu's documentation is also very rich, explaining the core design and the principles of some plug-ins in a very detailed manner. Apache ShenYu is implemented in Java. As a no-brand designer, I am still very porridge. But despite this, it is really painful to study it.

Because the instructor asked us to pay attention to the coding style, we have strictly required our own coding until today, and constantly practiced my code cleanliness skills. I think my coding is very standardized, but I was really defeated in the first pr. On the one hand, the process is not very clear.
