## description

* This doc gives a brief description for upload and download files using `Apache ShenYu`.

## File Upload

* The default file size limit is `10M`.
* For custom limitation, use`--file.size` with an integer variable. e.g.`--file.size = 30`
* Upload your files just as way you did before

## File Download

* `Apache ShenYu` supports download files in stream. There is no need to change anything.
