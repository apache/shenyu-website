I am extremely grateful to the Apache ShenYu community for recognizing my contributions and giving me the opportunity to become a Committer for this outstanding open-source project. Today, I would like to share my experience participating in the Apache ShenYu project, the growth I have achieved, and some suggestions.\\n\\n### Getting to know Apache ShenYu\\n\\nMy journey with Apache ShenYu began during my exploration of gateway technology options for my company. Upon discovering the ShenYu project, I was immediately intrigued by its high performance, multi-protocol support, easy scalability, and the wealth of ready-to-use plugins it offered. As a result, I decided to delve deeper into it and successfully ran the dev version of ShenYu in my local environment.\\n\\n### My way to Open source\\n\\nAs a full-stack engineer, I have a certain understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies, which enabled me to comprehensively understand and experience ShenYu. During my trial period, I identified numerous areas for optimization and decided to take action. I created a task list, tackled each issue one by one, and submitted my improvements to the community.\\n\\nOn the front-end side, my optimizations primarily included:\\n\\n* Thoroughly reviewing the entire website\'s styling and fixing multiple style anomalies. Although these anomalies seemed minor, they directly impacted users\' visual experience. By addressing these issues, I was able to enhance the cleanliness and aesthetics of ShenYu\'s front-end interface, thereby improving users\' overall experience.\\n\\n* Implementing multiple experience enhancements. These enhancements ranged from adjusting the position of a button to improving the interaction logic of an interface. By making these optimizations, I made ShenYu\'s front-end interface more intuitive and significantly enhanced users\' convenience.\\n\\n* Actively addressing over twenty front-end-related issues. These issues included both problems encountered by users during their usage and suggestions for improvement proposed by community members. I carefully analyzed the causes of each issue and successfully resolved them, contributing to the stability of ShenYu\'s front-end.\\n\\nOn the back-end side, my contributions mainly focused on:\\n\\n* Handling over ten back-end-related issues. These issues encompassed bug fixes and feature enhancements. Through referencing documentation, debugging code, and ultimately seeking feedback from project managers, I resolved each issue.\\n\\n* Implementing a new [`isBlank`](https://github.com/apache/shenyu/pull/4983) conditional judgment function. This function facilitates the determination of whether a request contains a specific parameter, providing convenience for back-end logical processing.\\n\\n* Developing a new plugin, [`basic-auth`](https://github.com/apache/shenyu/pull/5258). This plugin enables basic authentication and authorization functionality. Through collaboration with other community members, I successfully completed the plugin\'s development and testing, integrating it into ShenYu.\\n\\n# My experience in Apahce ShenYu Community\\n\\nAs I submitted more and more pull requests, I gradually delved deeper into the core of the Apache ShenYu community. Here, I felt the enthusiasm and openness of the community members. They were always willing to share knowledge and experience, helping me better understand and use ShenYu. After a period of hard work and accumulation, I received an invitation from the ShenYu community to officially become a Committer of this outstanding team.\\n\\nBecoming an Apache Committer is not only an honor for me but also a responsibility and commitment. It represents the community\'s trust and recognition of me, and it also strengthened my determination to contribute to the community. I am well aware that becoming a Committer is merely a new starting point. In the days ahead, I will continue to participate in ShenYu\'s optimization and development work, constantly enhancing my skills and capabilities. I will keep up with community updates and demands, actively participate in community activities and discussions, and contribute even more to ShenYu\'s growth.\\n\\nMoreover, I plan to further delve into the technical details and architectural principles of Apache ShenYu, enabling me to better provide technical support and solutions to the community. I believe that through continuous learning and practice, I can become a more accomplished Committer and make even greater contributions to Apache ShenYu\'s development.\\n\\nFinally, I want to express my gratitude to the Apache ShenYu community for giving me this opportunity and trust, as well as to all community members for their support and assistance. I am confident that with our collective efforts, Apache ShenYu will continue to excel!\\n\\nThanks all!"},{"id":"/Apache-ShenYu-WASM-release-version-1.0.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/Apache-ShenYu-WASM-release-version-1.0.0","source":"@site/news/Apache-ShenYu-WASM-release-version-1.0.0.md","title":"[Apache ShenYu WASM 1.0.0 Version Release]","description":"Apache ShenYu 1.0.0 Version Release","date":"2024-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 6, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Apache ShenYu WASM","permalink":"/news/tags/apache-shen-yu-wasm"},{"label":"WASM","permalink":"/news/tags/wasm"}],"readingTime":0.96,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"[Apache ShenYu WASM 1.0.0 Version Release]","description":"Apache ShenYu 1.0.0 Version Release","categories":"Apache ShenYu WASM","tags":["Apache ShenYu WASM","WASM"],"date":"2024-01-06T00:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"[Co-authoring the future with ShenYu]","permalink":"/news/2024/04/08/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-"},"nextItem":{"title":"[Apache ShenYu 2.6.0 Version Release]","permalink":"/news/Apache-ShenYu-release-version-2.6.0"}},"content":"## Apache ShenYu\\n\\nApache ShenYu is a responsive API gateway developed using Java Reactor.

After introducing me to the Shenyu community, he constantly guided me, led me to understand the project, explained the relevant regulations of the community, and under his encouragement, I submitted my first PR about open source projects in my life. In the following days, I mainly tried to study the code of Shenyu, modify some small errors, and do some unit tests or Integration testing of plugins.\\n\\n### Gradually reaching a better state\\n\\nAs a developer, I certainly don\'t want my contribution to Shenyu to be limited to testing type tasks. It was during Shenyu\'s registration for the Google Summer of Code event, so I actively reviewed the topics and ultimately decided to participate in the Shenyu plugin logging elastic search project. Under the patient guidance of Teacher Xiao Yu (Cat Adult), I finally completed the project and successfully submitted the development related code for Shenyu. Through this project, I have gained a better understanding of Shenyu, and at the same time, I am more eager to continue contributing code to Shenyu. Afterwards, I attempted to contribute two load balancing strategies to Shenyu, and will now and in the future contribute to the Shenyu-e2e module.\\n\\n### Harvest full\\n\\n- Learned more about gateways and services.\\n\\n- Learned the registration principles of different registration centers.\\n\\n- Learned the synchronization principles of different data synchronization methods.\\n\\n- Learned how to write more elegant code.\\n\\n### Some suggestions\\n\\n- Learn to read official documents. The document is now quite complete and can basically cover the needs of users.\\n- Attend weekly meetings. Shenyu holds a regular meeting every two weeks to introduce the current development progress of the project. Friends can choose tasks they are interested in for development, and they can also communicate with the big shots about technology.\\n\\n### Special Thanks\\n\\nI have always believed that Shenyu is a big family with warmth. When I encountered difficulties, many friends provided me with great help, which saved me from taking many detours when making contributions.

Let me share with you my first meet, acquaintance, understanding, growth and suggestions with the Apache ShenYu community.\\n\\n### Meet the Apache Shenyu community for the first time\\n\\nThe story starts from 2020. In the early stage, I used SpringCloud Gateway + Nacos Config Event to realize the dynamic routing of gateway by myself. Because there was no dashboard of Gateway at that time, it was very painful. My team made a dashboard based on Micro Enterprise, which has a lot of functionality and limitations. From then on, I started to pursue a good gateway. One day, I found ShenYu, and saw that ShenYu\'s overall architecture was in sharper contrast to SpringCloud Gateway. ShenYu outperforms Gateway in terms of overall architecture design, function design, plug-in design, etc. ShenYu can be said to be the next generation gateway product. After that, I started to have a certain understanding of Apache ShenYu from building environment to running example project, and then to read plug-in chain and data synchronization, SPI mechanism and other source code.\\n\\n### Start submitting PR\\n\\nIt was not until January 2022 that I started to submit my first PR, which was to fix a problem that caused null Pointers when the Admin module started the default load instance. The function was small, but its significance was remarkable.

Let me share with you my growth and suggestions during my participation in the Apache ShenYu community.\\n\\n## First acquaintance with ShenYu gateway\\n\\nThe earliest contact with shenyu was around March 2021. It named soul at that time. Since the business scenarios of the department required the use of a unified gateway, the main reason for choosing the shenyu gateway was that the plug-in design of shenyu was very suitable for the scenarios we needed. Functional plug-ins include divide, sentinel fuse, ratelimiter, protocol conversion of the company\'s internal rpc, and log2Mongo, etc. With the continuous upgrade of shenyu version, we are also constantly upgrading our code.\\n\\nWhen I read Shenyu\'s code, I like most developers, had the following questions: What exactly is reactive programming? How to write reactive programming? How can shenyu\'s code be written like this? With these questions, I read the source code of shenyu many times, and then debugged shenyu myself to see how shenyu handles requests and the specific logic of each plugin. During this period, I have also raised many issues in the shenyu community, thank the shenyu community for their help.\\n\\n## My OpenSource experience\\n\\nThe first time I submitted the code to shenyu was in March 2022. At that time, it was mainly found that the request body lost data when using rpc for protocol conversion, and then I found that the data was lost due to the rpc parameter conversion plugin, so I submitted my code to solve the bug of shenyu. \\n\\nI contributed the following functions:\\n- springboot upgrade\\n- refactor springcloud plugin\\n- refactor cache plugin\\n- refactor logging module and logging plugins.\\n- refactor shenyu documents\\n\\n### Thanks to the community\\n\\nSpecial thanks to everyone who helped me (in no particular order):yu199195\uff0cqicz\uff0cli-keguo\uff0cdragon-zhang\uff0crenzhuyan\uff0chutaishi\uff0cimpactCn\uff0cyunlongn\u3002\\n\\n### A few words for open source developers\\n\\nOpen source development is actually a very meaningful and painful thing. It tests a person\'s endurance. After countless PRs, they may give up due to certain difficulties and problems, but those who persist, whether in terms of technology or communication skills , or open source contributions, there will be certain gains.\\n\\nOpen source is not about doing tasks blindly, nor is it fixed in a certain project or a certain task, but you can participate in any project when you are free. One person will get it quickly, but a group of people will go further!\\n\\n### How to join Apache ShenYu\\n\\n1.

I am honored to be invited to be a Committer of Apache ShenYu community. As a business developer, I usually focus on business and then write CRUD, while participating in the open source of Apache ShenYu community gives me a different experience. More attention is paid to the code itself,  consider how to support various protocols, plug-in extensions, data synchronization, and more.  I would like to share with you my growth and suggestions during my participation in the Apache ShenYu community.\\n\\n### Meet the Apache Shenyu community for the first time\\n\\nThe story timeline has to go back to the end of 2020. At that time, in order to allow us to grow better, the department signed us up for the JAVA advanced training camp of Geek Time, that is, in this training camp, we were fortunate enough to get to know Mr. Cat. Under the leadership of Mr. Mao\'s source code reading activity, I first came into contact with Apache Shenyu, which was not yet in the Apache incubator, and was also called Soul (hereinafter referred to as Apache Shenyu). The activity of reading the source code of Apache Shenyu lasted for three weeks in total. During the three weeks, we read the source code and blogged every day, from setting up the environment to running the example project, to reading the source code of the plug-in chain and data synchronization. Also have a certain understanding.\\n\\n### Start submitting PR\\n\\nIn May 2021, I started to submit my first PR. At that time, I added a unit test to the Admin module. The function was small, but its significance was extraordinary, it meant that I started from learning to contributing, from playing to open source, which made a good start on the road of open source.\\n\\n### Ongoing open source contributions and gains\\n\\nSo far, I have participated in the open source of Apache Shenyu community for more than a year, and I have made a lot of contributions and gained a lot of growth.  Details are as follows:\\n- Participated in soul\'s migration to Apache Incubator and renamed Apache Shenyu.\\n- Participate in the writing of unit tests for each module.\\n- Responsible for integrating TarsResponsePlugin, GrpcResponsePlugin, SofaResponsePlugin, DubboResponsePlugin, etc. and refactoring them into ResponsePlugin for unified processing.\\n- Responsible for Admin Oracle database support.\\n- Responsible for the support of Shenyu gateway instance registration to Consul.\\n- Participated in the repair of some found problems, sample project writing, JAR package replacement and upgrade, integration test writing, etc.\\n\\n### Thanks to the community\\n\\nThanks to my friends who helped me or inspired me for free (in no particular order): yu199195\uff0cdragon-zhang\uff0cli-keguo\uff0cqicz\uff0cmoremind\uff0czouchangfu\uff0clianjunwei\\n\\n### A little advice for newcomers\\n\\nApache Way has a philosophy: community is greater than code, and we firmly believe that a healthy community is more important than good code. After more than a year of participation, I also felt that Apache Shenyu community has put this into practice very well, such as bi-weekly meetings, consensual voluntary tasks, open and transparent community, and enthusiastic help from partners.  So today I will also give this sentence to newcomers. The community is bigger than the code. Here, you can try it.\\n\\n### How to join Apache ShenYu\\n\\n1.

It is my honor to be invited by the Apache ShenYu community as the Committer. Let me share with you my first meet, acquaintance, understanding, growth and suggestions with the Apache ShenYu community.\\n\\n### First Meet\\n\\nIn mid-August 2021, I joined the current company and transformed into middleware developer (doing business development in my previous company). The first task I received was to familiarize myself with the company\'s gateway middleware as soon as possible. So a gateway called Soul entered my field of vision (Soul is the predecessor of ShenYu, ShenYu entered the Apache incubator in 2021, the following Soul/ShenYu refers to Apache ShenYu(incubating) ).\\n\\n### Acquaintance\\n\\nAfter about a week of study, I have a certain degree of understanding of the code of Soul. In the following 2-3 months, as I continued to help the company\'s business developer to answer and solve problems, I gradually discovered some parts of the Soul that were not ergonomic.\\n\\nUntil December 2021, out of company needs and personal interests, I started to investigate ShenYu and consider an upgrade plan, and then I really started to contact ShenYu and the community.\\n\\n### Understanding\\n\\nShenYu is an asynchronous, high-performance, cross-language, and responsive API gateway. It adheres to the design concept of plugin and full-link asynchronous. At present, many plugins have been integrated for users to choose. If the existing plugins does not meet your needs, you can start customized development by studying [the official website documents](https://ShenYu.apache.org/docs/next/developer/custom-plugin/) .\\n\\nThe ShenYu community is active and friendly. In order to allow more people to become Contributor/Committer, [new tasks](https://github.com/apache/incubator-ShenYu/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22status%3A+volunteer+wanted%22) are released from time to time on the [issues](https://github.com/apache/incubator-ShenYu/issues) page of Github. There are many [tasks for novices](https://github.com/apache/incubator-ShenYu/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). Even if the released task is a little difficult for you, you can still try to submit a PR. The community members will review your PR and provide some guidance and suggestions to help you improve yourself in the collision of ideas.\\n\\n### My Community Grows\\n\\nFirst, I would like to thank the friends in community who helped me for free (in no particular order): yu199195, JooKS-me, KevinClair, lianjunwei, qicz, AhahaGe, hutaishi\\n\\n#### Contribution and Gain\\n\\n- Learn how to be compatible with both spring-boot 1.x and 2.x, and contribute a lot of solutions.\\n- Get familiar with the use of project-reactor and spring-webflux, and then contribute a lot of optimizations.\\n- After getting familiar with netty, contributed netty thread pool settings.\\n- After getting familiar with dubbo, expanded the dubbo thread pool in ShenYu.\\n- Learn about RPCs such as grpc and motan, and contribute to shared thread pool technology.\\n- Provide MemoryLimitedLinkedBlockingQueue and MemorySafeLRUMap, which solved the technical paradox.\\n\\n#### Suggestion for Contributing to Apache ShenYu\\n\\n1. First meet\\n\\n   Starting from the official website documentation, the first is [admin/bootstrap deployment](https://ShenYu.apache.org/docs/next/deployment/deployment-local/) , and then choose a way that you are most familiar with [to access ShenYu](https://ShenYu.apache.org/docs/next/quick-start/quick-start-dubbo/), and finally send a request to verify whether the access is successful.\\n\\n2. Familiar\\n   \\n   After a period of time, you will be familiar with the use of ShenYu. At this point, you can start with an access way and see how the data is finally sent to ShenYu-admin and stored.\\n\\n3. Slightly successful\\n\\n   You are already familiar with a certain code in the registration phase, and you can start to sort out the main link of ShenYu-bootstrap in the running phase according to your access way. At this time, it is not recommended digging into the details of each plugin.\\n\\n4. Understanding\\n\\n   At this time, you already have a certain understanding of the overall situation of ShenYu. Maybe you have discovered some small bugs of ShenYu at this stage, or you think some of ShenYu\'s postures are not ergonomic, so what are you waiting for?\\n\\n   Go to the community to see if anyone has the same problem as you, you can submit some BUG/ISSUE/PR, the community will reply you as soon as possible.\\n\\n5. Outstanding\\n\\n   As you continue to participate in the community, you contribute more and more to the community, and eventually you can help others solve problems and be able to mentor others.\\n\\n   You are always curious, you learn deeply, and you can stand on the bottom.\\n\\n   You have a certain big-picture view and can look at optimization from a global perspective.\\n\\n   You can see the essence of the problem and solve the root problem.\\n\\n#### How to join Apache ShenYu\\n\\n1.

Later, I slowly learned that there were so many people active in the open source community in China, which greatly promoted the development of the open source ecosystem. It was also a very coincidence that I met the VP (Xiao Yu) of Apache ShenYu, who was my mentor in the Apache ShardingSphere community during the summer of open source. After I completed the task of open source summer ahead of schedule, I saw that ShenYu had just entered the Apache incubator, and it was in full swing, so I started to contact Apache ShenYu.\\n\\n### Grow In The Community\\n\\nMy earliest contribution to ShenYu was not code, but documentation. At that time, I found a few typo on the official website, so I decisively submitted a pr and  become ShenYu\'s Contributor.\\n\\nLater, after participating in the regular meeting of the community, I found that ShenYu, as an Apache incubator project, actually still has many places to be optimized and enriched. So, I started with integration testing and started the journey of fighting monsters and upgrading.\\n\\nIn fact, there are a lot of things that can be learned by doing integration testing, from Docker, CI to ShenYu\'s functional implementation details, microservice ecology and so on. Sometimes inappropriateness of the official website documentation is found during testing, so you need to read the source code yourself, understand the code logic, and then improve or correct the documentation; sometimes some bugs are found, so you can be familiar with ShenYu gateway in locating bugs and fixing bugs details. Later, you can gradually implement some new features yourself.\\n\\nWhile getting familiar with the ShenYu project, the sense of awe for ShenYu is also getting higher and higher. Design patterns, asynchronous programming, functional programming, etc. in ShenYu are all very ingenious and worth learning.\\n\\n### Harvest In Open Source\\n\\nLooking back on the past six months since I participated in open source, I feel that I have gained a lot, which is mainly reflected in the following aspects.\\n\\n1. Improvement of technical level. Participating in open source can not only get in touch with a lot of knowledge that cannot be learned in school, but also can see the practical scene of \\"slaying dragon martial arts\\" that I have learned. As an API gateway, Apache ShenYu is the entrance to the entire microservice system. While participating in the project construction, you will naturally be exposed to various knowledge in the field of microservices.\\n\\n2. Broaden the horizons. Personally experiencing the discussion of the new feature of the project and participating in activities such as ApacheCon and the Open Source Annual Conference have enabled me to have a more systematic understanding and thinking about the microservice ecology and development trends.\\n\\n3. Help with job interviews. The addition of open source experience on my resume has really helped me in my interview for an internship, and it has also been affirmed by the interviewer.\\n\\n### Some Advice For Newcomers\\n\\n1. Adapt to asynchronous communication. Different from our usual communication methods, the open source community often uses asynchronous communication methods, such as mailing lists, GitHub issues, Jira, etc. The priority of the communication methods recommended by the Apache ShenYu community is: mailing list > Github issue > WeChat group . This is because through the mailing list and github, the discussion process and results of the issue can be retained, which is open and transparent. On the other hand, throwing questions on the mailing list is often the quickest and most effective solution.\\n\\n2. Actively participate in discussions. Community trumps code, this is what the Apache Way advocates. The code obtained through full communication and discussion is more vibrant. In addition, the Apache ShenYu community will hold an online regular meeting every two weeks, which will periodically summarize the work of the community, as well as the goals and tasks after the discussion (and will also be posted to the mailing list).\\n\\n3. How to contribute? The first is after the above-mentioned discussion, and then the hands-on. For those who have not applied ShenYu in their work, writing integration tests and source code analysis articles is a very good entry point. At the same time, the Apache ShenYu community often publishes a lot of easy or difficult tasks, and we all look forward to your participation.\\n\\n4. Advice for current students who want to get involved in open source but haven\'t done it yet. Participate in open source boldly. Among the several open source communities I have come into contact with, students are more friendly, expectant and tolerant. In addition, some organizations will hold activities to guide student groups to participate in open source, such as Open Source Summer (mentioned above), GSoC (Google Summer of Programming), etc., which are also very good ways to participate, not only will there be generous bonuses, but also Get to know a lot of friends and tech giants."},{"id":"/2021/11/11/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2021/11/11/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-","source":"@site/news/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-2021-11-11.md","title":"[From users to Committer, different experiences and gains]","description":"From users to Committer, different experiences and gains","date":"2021-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 11, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Apache ShenYu","permalink":"/news/tags/apache-shen-yu"}],"readingTime":4.39,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"qicz"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"[From users to Committer, different experiences and gains]","author":"qicz","description":"From users to Committer, different experiences and gains","categories":"Apache ShenYu Committers","tags":["Apache ShenYu"],"date":"2021-11-11T00:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"[The way from University Student to Apache Committer]","permalink":"/news/2021/12/08/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-"},"nextItem":{"title":"[Apache ShenYu(incubating) newly promoted PPMC]","permalink":"/news/2021/11/05/Apache-ShenYu-PPMC-"}},"content":"### New Committer Introduction\\n\\nHello everyone, my name is qicz, and I am very honored to be invited by the Apache ShenYu community to become Apache ShenYu Committer. I am a \\"unknown\\" programmer. Miscellaneous, because I was also a part of entrepreneurship that year and that month. At that time, I often had to choose a different programming language to practice miscellaneous. In the process, there were more opportunities to learn about and contact many varieties of projects. . I am also an open source enthusiast, and I like \\"playing with code\\", so I often find myself in the open source community. I have always been adhering to the concept of open source and have worked on several open source projects. There are often many fun and interesting open source projects in the community, and Apache ShenYu is one of them. Next, I will briefly share with you my feelings during the time I participated in the Apache ShenYu community\u3002\\n\\n### Mental journey\\n\\n\u200b\\tI learned that Soul is a very early time. The official contact with Apache ShenYu was in September of this year. At that time, I just received the company\'s gateway demand, and it took a short time to master and produce something.\\n\\n\u200b\\tFor gateway projects, there have been studies before, such as Spring Gateway, Kong, etc. After this period of research and continuous participation in the Apache ShenYu project, I am very satisfied with its design concept-plug-in, everything is done based on plug-ins. Although gateways like Kong also support plug-ins, lua is really not fun. The other is that Apache ShenYu\'s documentation is also very rich, explaining the core design and the principles of some plug-ins in a very detailed manner. Apache ShenYu is implemented in Java. As a no-brand designer, I am still very porridge. But despite this, it is really painful to study it. The first time I saw the source code of Apache ShenYu, it was very big, and the modules were divided into many details.\\n\\nEverything is difficult at the beginning, and it may be smooth if you have a good beginning. My beginning was about the processing of crossfilter, and put the configuration written in the code into the external configuration file. Looking back on the process of submitting pr for the first time, it was really boring, and I still feel too painful until now.\\n\\n### Provide Pull Request\\n\\n\u200b\\t  First of all, all issues, prs, and emails must be in English. I haven\'t written things in English for some time. Many times I have written by myself. I can\'t believe and determine if there is a problem with what I wrote. It is estimated that many times I have done Chinese English. However, based on my many years of entrepreneurial experience, everything is a paper tiger. In many cases, as long as I keep on doing it, it will get better and better. Up to now, the constant use of English to organize all kinds of things has become more and more comfortable. Happy! Beautiful! Wonderful!\\n\\n\u200b\\tAnother, every time you submit the checkstyle and test of pr, it is also very boring. Because the source code has very strict specifications, from comments to line breaks to punctuation. I have been in contact with programming since I was in college. Because the instructor asked us to pay attention to the coding style, we have strictly required our own coding until today, and constantly practiced my code cleanliness skills. I think my coding is very standardized, but I was really defeated in the first pr. On the one hand, the process is not very clear. On the other hand, because of the large number of modules, the local package checkstyle is very slow, and many problems require a complete package process to be exposed. I remember the longest time since it took almost 2 hours.\\n\\nThis process is really too painful. But after many attempts, the first pr succeeded. The difficult beginning is over. But from a personal point of view, it is very supportive and agreeable. If there is no such meticulous requirement, how can we better build this project and community, and use this as a basis to help and serve more small partners.\\n\\n### Community and company integration\\n\\n\u200b\\tIn the process of continuously matching the company\'s needs, the research on Apache ShenYu is also constantly deepening. I started to do some customized development. In the process, other bugs were constantly discovered, so there were second, third and more prs. In this process, many times are completed on weekends or staying up late. It is really tiring, but it is still very fulfilling. Especially when my own PR solves the actual needs and is recognized by the community at the same time, it is really an achievement. Feeling full.\\n\\n\u200b\\tWith the passage of time, I now have a deep understanding of Apache ShenYu. In the future, I will do my best to devote my spare time to the construction of the community and gather actual needs, regardless of the design and development of various features. Adhere to the original intention of open source-from the community to give back to the community, make more contributions to the community, and grow together with the community."},{"id":"/2021/11/05/Apache-ShenYu-PPMC-","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2021/11/05/Apache-ShenYu-PPMC-","source":"@site/news/Apache-ShenYu-PPMC-2021-11-05.md","title":"[Apache ShenYu(incubating) newly promoted PPMC]","description":"Apache ShenYu(incubating) newly promoted PPMC","date":"2021-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 5, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Apache ShenYu","permalink":"/news/tags/apache-shen-yu"}],"readingTime":1.075,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Liang"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"[Apache ShenYu(incubating) newly promoted PPMC]","author":"Liu Liang","description":"Apache ShenYu(incubating) newly promoted PPMC","categories":"Apache ShenYu PPMC","tags":["Apache ShenYu"],"date":"2021-11-05T00:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"[From users to Committer, different experiences and gains]","permalink":"/news/2021/11/11/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-"},"nextItem":{"title":"[From users to Committer, participation in the Apache ShenYu community is not far away]","permalink":"/news/2021/09/08/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-"}},"content":"### Introduction of new PPMC\\n\\n- CMB Network Technology Software Development Engineer.\\n\\n- GithubID: midnight2104.\\n\\n- Email: midnight2104@apache.org\\n\\n### Community Contribution\\n\\n- Deeply involved in the development of `Apache ShenYu` plug-in system (`GRPC` plugin, etc.).\\n\\n- Practice the `Apache Way`, be active in the community, help others, and actively participate in source code activities and official website documentation construction.\\n\\n### Community Experience\\n\\n- Community over code: Creating a good community atmosphere is important, more important than writing code.

I am currently working in Dmall(Chengdu)E-commerce Co.,Ltd, and I focus on distributed task scheduling and messaging engine. I am very honored to receive an invitation from the Apache ShenYu community to become the Committer of Apache ShenYu. Let me share with you my growth and suggestions during the time I participated in the Apache ShenYu community.\\n\\n### Getting to know the Apache Shenyu community for the first time\\n\\n  At the beginning of this year, I learned about the Apache ShenYu gateway during the research of the API gateway (hereafter referred to as Apache ShenYu (incubating) by ShenYu). ShenYu has high-performance, multi-protocol, easy to expand, and reactive features, and has provided a variety of plug-ins, out-of-the-box, very potential, I try to learn it.\\n\\n  In addition to the official documents, ShenYu also has source code analysis provided by many community partners, so you can quickly understand the implementation principle on the basis of rapid use. The community is very active, everyone actively reports and fixes bugs encountered, discusses new ideas together, and helps new friends integrate into the community. For the problems encountered in the first use, if you raise an issue or consult in the community exchange area, friends in the community will actively answer your doubts. These documents and community friends helped me quickly get started with the ShenYu gateway, and also made me feel the friendly and positive atmosphere of the ShenYu community.\\n\\n### Open source is not far away\\n\\n  When I first read the source code of ShenYu, I saw that the code was a bit redundant and could be streamlined. Based on this, I wanted to create an issue, and worried that the optimization was too small to be accepted by the community. After tangled up, I still created an issue based on the previous issue format to express my thoughts. After a short while, I received feedback from the community, encouraging me to submit a PR to optimize this code. I followed the community\'s contribution guide and completed this small optimization step by step. The new PR was quickly merged and I saw myself in the Contributor list. This is the transition from ordinary users to contributor. Although it is simple, it motivates me a lot and makes me feel that open source is not far away.\\n\\n  After that, I became more and more familiar with ShenYu\'s code, and the relationship between the various modules was gradually sorted out. And I learned a lot of elegant design ideas from the project. During the period, I occasionally found some bugs, code and functions that can be optimized. I took the initiative to put forward issues to fix and improve these problems. The Committer of the community will review the code very carefully every time and give some suggestions for improvement. Later, I also participated in the construction of the official website of the community, writing and improving documents.\\n\\n  The ShenYu community is open and inclusive. Some tasks are often released, and many of them are suitable for novices. In fact, they are to help more people integrate into the community. You can follow the community mail, issue, WeChat group, etc. to receive tasks, have a goal to complete, and get familiar with the project faster. At the same time, the community has an open weekly meeting, everyone can participate in, and you can understand the current function development progress of ShenYu, and the community\'s planning.\\n\\n  After becoming Committer, in addition to continuing to follow up on issues in the community, I will also actively think about and participate in the development of some new features, and strive to make more contributions to the community and grow together with the community.\\n\\n### Some suggestions for newcomers\\n\\n  For those who want to participate in open source, here are some small suggestions:\\n\\n- Starting from the official documentation, first use the main functions of the project to have an overall understanding. Then refer to some source code analysis articles in the community to understand the details of the internal implementation. There may be some small difficulties at the beginning. You can start with a simple small issue and gradually participate in the contribution of the community.\\n\\n- Boldly put forward your ideas, whether it is code structure, new functions, or questions about use, you can raise them. The form of contribution is not limited to code, but also includes documentation, active participation in feature discussions, helping other friends to answer questions, and so on.\\n\\n- Actively pay attention to the community, receive the tasks released by the community, and communicate with other people in the community if you have any questions about the implementation."},{"id":"/Apache-ShenYu-release-milestone-version-2.4.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/Apache-ShenYu-release-milestone-version-2.4.0","source":"@site/news/Apache-ShenYu-release-milestone-version-2.4.0.md","title":"\u3010Release the first version of Apache ShenYu(Incubating)2.4.0\u3011 Make API gateway easy","description":"\u3010Release the first version of Apache ShenYu(Incubating)2.4.0\u3011 Make API gateway easy","date":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 1, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Apache ShenYu","permalink":"/news/tags/apache-shen-yu"}],"readingTime":13.77,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"xiaoyu"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"\u3010Release the first version of Apache ShenYu(Incubating)2.4.0\u3011 Make API gateway easy","author":"xiaoyu","description":"\u3010Release the first version of Apache ShenYu(Incubating)2.4.0\u3011 Make API gateway easy","categories":"Apache ShenYu","tags":["Apache ShenYu"],"date":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","cover":"/img/architecture/shenyu-framework.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"[From users to Committer, participation in the Apache ShenYu community is not far away]","permalink":"/news/2021/09/08/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-"},"nextItem":{"title":"[How I became an Apache ShenYu Committer one year after graduation]","permalink":"/news/2021/07/27/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-"}},"content":"## [Release the first version of Apache - 2.4.0] Make API Gateway Simple\\n\\n> Disclaimer: In this article, `Apache ShenYu` refers to `Apache ShenYu (incubating)`\\n> Author: Xiao Yu Apache ShenYu(incubating) Founder && PPMC\\n> 2.4.0 Release Manager: Zhang Yonglun Apache ShenYu(incubating) PPMC && Apache ShardingSphere PMC\\n\\nThe `Apache ShenYu` gateway is renamed from the original `Dromara/soul` gateway after donated to the `Apache` foundation.\\nThe `2.4.0` version released this time is the first version after the `Apache ShenYu` gateway enters the `Apache Incubator`. This version involves many new features,The project name, package name, and `maven` coordinates are changed.\\n\\n## What Is Apache ShenYu?\\n\\n`Apache ShenYu` is developed using the `Java reactor` programming method, and is an `API gateway` with features such as `asynchronous`, `high performance`, and `cross-language`.\\nIn terms of flow control, there is an exquisite Admin console, which can `precise` and `dynamic` control flow to meet complex business scenarios.\\nIn terms of functions, it uses plug-in design ideas and supports many common protocols: such as `http/https`, `Dubbo`, `Spring Cloud`, `gRPC`, `Motan`, `Sofa`, `Tars`, etc.\\nAnd built-in very rich function plug-ins, such as `circuit breaking`, `current limit`, `authentication`, `access control`, `firewall`, `monitoring`, `parameter change` and so on. Its architecture diagram is as follows:\\n\\n![](/img/architecture/shenyu-framework.png)\\n\\n## Flow Control\\n\\nThe control of flow is the soul of the gateway. For flow control, `Apache ShenYu` has designed two concepts of `selector` and `rule` to control the flow.\\n\\n`Selector` and `Rule` are the most soulful things in the `Apache ShenYu` gateway. Master it, you can manage any traffic.\\n\\nA plug-in has multiple selectors, and a selector has multiple rules. The selector is equivalent to the first-level screening of traffic, and the rule is the final screening.\\n\\nFor a plug-in, we hope that according to our configuration, the plug-in will be executed only if the traffic meets the conditions.\\n\\nThe purpose of selectors and rules is to allow traffic to perform what we want when certain conditions are met. This kind of rules must first be understood.\\n\\nThe plug-in, selector, and rule execution logic are as follows. When traffic enters the Apache ShenYu gateway, it will first determine whether there is a corresponding plug-in and whether the plug-in is enabled; then it will determine whether the traffic matches the plug-in\'s selector.\\n\\nThen determine whether the traffic matches the rule of the selector. If the requested traffic meets the matching conditions, the plug-in will be executed, otherwise the plug-in will not be executed and the next one will be processed.\\n\\nThis is how the Apache ShenYu gateway completes flow control through layers of filtering. The flow chart is as follows:\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/shenyu/plugin/plugin-chain-execute-en.jpg\\" width=\\"80%\\" height=\\"70%\\"/>\\n\\n## Traffic filtering\\n\\nTraffic filtering is the soul of `selectors` and `rules`, corresponding to the matching `conditions` in the selectors and rules. According to different traffic filtering rules, we can handle various complex scenarios.\\n\\nTraffic filtering can obtain data from Http requests such as `Header`, `URI`, `Query`, `Cookie`,\\n\\nThen you can use `Match`, `=`, `SpEL`, `Regex`, `Groovy` and other matching methods to match the data you expected.\\n\\nYou can use the matching strategy of `And/Or` to add multiple sets of matching. The above are all using `SPI design ideas`, users can `self-expand`: For more, please see: https://shenyu.apache.org/docs/user-guide/admin-usage/selector-and-rule\\n\\nThe process diagram is as follows:\\n\\n![](/img/shenyu/design/flow-condition.png)\\n\\n## Data synchronization and caching\\n\\nIn order to improve the `performance` of the gateway, the `Apache ShenYu` gateway will cache all flow control rules in the `JVM` memory.\\n\\nIn the `cluster deployment/distributed` scenario, `Apache ShenYu` independently developed a set of Remote synchronization of Admin console data to the JVM memory of each Apache ShenYu gateway node.\\n\\nEach scheme adopts the design idea of SPI, so that users can choose flexibly. Currently supported schemes are `HttpLongPull`, `Websocket`, `Zookeeper`, `Nacos`, `Consul`, `ETCD`.\\n\\nThe overall process is as follows:\\n\\n![](/img/shenyu/dataSync/config-strategy-processor-zh.png)\\n\\n## Admin console\\n\\nIn order to facilitate the user to quickly and conveniently control the flow and all the functional characteristics of the gateway, `Apache ShenYu` provides a very beautiful `Admin console`, the user can `Chinese and English switch`, on this, you can freely `control the flow` , `Start-stop plug-in`, `Configure different parameters and strategies`, these operation changes are synchronized to the gateway\'s `JVM memory` through the aforementioned `data synchronization principle`. The background diagram is as follows:\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/community/admin_homepage_en.jpg\\"/>\\n\\n##### Menu/data permissions\\n\\nThe background management of the gateway is agent. For enterprise-level users and cross-departmental applications, `Apache Shenyu` designs a common `authorization control system`, including `button level menu permissions`, and `row data level data Permissions`. And these permissions are automatically configurable by the `administrator`.\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/community/admin-permission-en.jpg\\"/>\\n\\n## Protocol Proxy\\n\\nProtocol proxy is the core function of the gateway. Currently `Apache ShenYu` supports `http` to `http/https`, `Websocket`, `Dubbo`, `Spring Cloud`, `gRPC`, `Motan`, `Sofa` The conversion of protocols such as `Tars`, etc. will support `TCP`, `MQTT`, `MQTT` and other protocols in the future.\\n\\n#### Divide Plugin\\n\\nThe `Divide` plug-in is a plug-in used to specifically proxy `http/https/websocket` and other methods to request the `Apache ShenYu` gateway. It has functions such as `load balancing`, `traffic preheating`, `node discovery`, `timeout retry`, `timeout control` and so on. If users want to use it, please add the following dependencies in the gateway, and then set it to `on` in `Admin console` --\x3e `Plugin management` --\x3e `Divide plugin`.

My name is Liu Liang. I am working as a software development engineer in China Merchants Network Technology Co., LTD. It is my great honor to receive the invitation of Apache ShenYu community to become a Committer of Apache ShenYu. Now I would like to share with you my growth and suggestions during my participation in Apache ShenYu community.\\n\\n\\n### Know Open Source\\n\\nAfter graduation last year, I feel that my skills are far from enough, so I am constantly learning. Along the way, one of the teachers offered the opportunity to participate in an open source project. I started with the idea that working on open source projects would improve my skills and help me get a job.\\n\\nThe open source project involved is Apache ShenYu(Incubating), which is an asynchronous, high-performance, cross-language, responsive API gateway. In the community communication group, there are many active students who actively discuss issues and consciously find bugs.\\n\\n\\n### Participate in the open source\\n\\n\\nMy first task was to add test cases. Tasks are usually posted as an issue, and if you\'re interested, reply under the issue. Fortunately, the official community provides an action document that simply follows the steps above, mainly forking the project into its repository, pulling it locally, creating the corresponding issue branch locally, and then actually writing code.\\n\\n\\nThe first task is to write unit tests for the entity class. The solution is to call the get/set method via reflection, and when you\'re done, submit your code and merge it. This was my first PR contribution to an open source project, and I\'ve been a contributor to open source projects ever since, hahaha.\\n\\nThen I did other tasks. The second time, I looked back at the code I submitted the first time and found it was different from the one I submitted. I checked the git submission record and found that my code was committer refactored. I took a close look at my code and the refactored code and said, \\"Well, this is a more elegant way to write it.\\n\\nIn continuing to be involved, I\'ve gained a deeper understanding of Apache ShenYu(Incubator) projects and a greater understanding of the open source culture.\\n\\nApache ShenYu(Incubating) committers can often publish tasks through mail, issues, and community groups. I noticed that there was a feature on gRPC optimization that no one had done yet, and was ready to take it on. However, I still remember hesitating for a long time at that time. I don\'t know what to do with this feature. Can I handle it? GRPC is not used, I can also go to optimize? In constant doubt and denial...... This function is a core part of the project, so it\'s a rare opportunity. Why not try it first? Finally, I took a step to complete the task.\\n\\nThe next step is how to solve this problem. This is a very specific technical problem, I will not expand, mainly about their feelings. When you encounter a problem, you should first analyze what the specific problem is, where to start to solve it, why the existing solution does not work, and what results to achieve in the end, and communicate with others more. I\'ve also been in constant communication with Apache ShenYu(Incubating) PPMC while I\'ve been working on this issue, to discuss whether my solution is feasible. In the process of research and analysis, I have always backed down, because this problem is not easy for me to do. But PPMC in Apache ShenYu(Incubator) has been encouraging me: There\'s no time limit on this, you can take your time and talk to others about it. In this way, step by step, constantly consult, finally solved the problem, the submitted code was successfully merged by the project.\\n\\nAnd then later, you started in Apache ShenYu(Incubator weekly meetings) to learn what other people are doing, learn about incubating, and learn more about open source culture. I also contributed more to Apache ShenYu(Incubating) in its own website.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Experience in the Apache ShenYu(Incubating) community\\n\\nI have been talking about my open source experience in the past. In fact, this is my true inner activity and a process of growth. Since you\'ve been in open source, you\'ve slowly felt more open source charm, and the Apache ShenYu(Incubating) community is in a good mood.\\n\\n\\n- Community over Code: Building a good community is more important than writing code. The Apache ShenYu(Incubator) community is also working to improve, to get new users in and lower the threshold where possible;\\n\\n- Transparent and open decision making: community development, feature development, and user issues are made public and archived in mailing lists;\\n\\n- Equality and respect: focus on the communication of technical community, your contribution determines your authority;\\n\\n- Broaden vision: not satisfied with CRUD in daily work, participate in open source, your code will be reviewed, see what is good code, learn more about open source projects, improve personal technical ability;\\n\\n- No size of contribution: Whether you complete a core feature, write a test case, build a website, modify documentation, these contributions are the same and will be recognized by the community.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### A little advice for the new guy\\n\\nIf you have friends who are interested in open source, but have not participated in it yet, do you have these problems?\\n\\n\\n- If you ask too simple questions, do you seem incompetent? No, people are well prepared for technical discussions, their own questions, have more background information, and the community is happy to respond to you and answer your questions.\\n\\n- Newcomers don\'t know how to participate? The community provides documentation, follows through, and can participate. There are also novice missions that can be directly participated in.\\n\\n- No time? The development of the community is personal investment, no commercial interests, members are free time to participate in it, I believe you can also.\\n\\n- Too difficult to solve? Talk to people in your community. That\'s how you develop your skills."},{"id":"/2022/02/28/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2022/02/28/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-","source":"@site/news/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-2022-02-28.md","title":"[The Open Source Path for Tech Veterans]","description":"The Open Source Path for Tech Veterans","date":"2021-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 28, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Apache ShenYu","permalink":"/news/tags/apache-shen-yu"}],"readingTime":5.175,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Haibo Duan"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"[The Open Source Path for Tech Veterans]","author":"Haibo Duan","description":"The Open Source Path for Tech Veterans","categories":"Apache ShenYu Committers","tags":["Apache ShenYu"],"date":"2021-02-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"[How I became an Apache ShenYu Committer one year after graduation]","permalink":"/news/2021/07/27/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-"},"nextItem":{"title":"\u3010Soul gateway release milestone version 2.3.0\u3011New support for grpc, tars and sofa protocols!","permalink":"/news/Soul-gateway-release-milestone-version-2.3.0"}},"content":"### Self Introduction:\\n\\nHello everyone, my name is Duan Haibo, my github account is [haibo-duan](https://github.com/haibo-duan). It is my honor to be invited by the Apache ShenYu community as the Committer. Here, I would like to share with you my growth and advice from participating in the Apache ShenYu community.\\n\\n### Getting to know Apache ShenYu\\n\\nIn the last year\'s source code reading activity, Tt was my first time to hear about the Soul Gateway of the Dromara open source community officially joined the Apache Foundation incubator and renamed to ShenYu. Since ShenYu is the first open source project which named by Chinese traditional culture, which attracted me a lot since naming a procject can be frustrating for a programmer. Then, I followed to ShenYu\'s public account driven by curiosity. After that, I learned that ShenYu not only has the characteristics of high-performance, multi-protocol, and scalability, but also provides various plug-ins that can be used out of the box. With the mentality of learning, I forked the source code of ShenYu on github. I was amazed by the richness of the documentations and the great detailed description of the technical details. so I subscribed to ShenYu\'s email according to the description of the document, and tried to participate in the construction of the community.\\n\\n### My way to Open source\\n\\nThere was a time that the community organized a code cleaning event, aiming to clean and optimize the current shenyu code. I took a look at the requirements of this task which was not difficult, so I optimized some codes according to the specification with the mentality of giving it a try, and then submitted the first PR. Everything is difficult at the beginning. There were a lot of things to learn in the first PR, including the format of PR, the branch of code, and the submission process. Fortunately, all of these were described in the [Contributor Guide](https://shenyu.apache.org/community/contributor-guide)  in great detail. What impressed me the most was ShenYu\'s checkstyle, which was very strict to the specification, including comments and spaces. Although I had paid a lot of attention to code specifications, there was still a little difficult for me to use this checkstyle at the beginning. However, I got used to this process soon, since the code after unified checkstyle let me feel extremely comfortable.\\n\\nAfter the first PR from 0 to 1, the subsequent process was much easier. I found that the most time-consuming process of submitting a PR for local packaging was executing unit test cases. And I also found that there were still parts of the code that unit test code was not provided . Therefore, I decided to start participating in unit testing. First of all, I don\'t need to know too much source code since the tens of thousands of stock code in ShenYu is unable to be mastered in a day or two. In addition, results can be seen very quickly. In the process of writing unit test cases, I can not only find bugs in the source code to improve the code quality, but also understand the source code better.\\n\\nAt this time, some problems at work also required me to investigate the unit testing technology. When I learned about the new features of junit5, I found unit4 was used in Shenyu , so I sent an email to ask the ShenYu community if an upgrade was possible. After several rounds of discussions in the email, my proposal was accepted and I became the leader of this task. In the process of doing this task, I divided it into many small tasks due to the large amount of test code involved, and several new friends were attracted  to join together. In addition, in the task of this junit5 upgrade, it was also found that PowerMock was used in many previous use cases, which had a problem in the compatibility of the new version of jdk. So PowerMock had also been removed.\\n\\nThe ShenYu community is open and inclusive. After completing these tasks, I am very familiar with ShenYu\'s functional modules. In addition to continuing to follow up some issues in the community, I can also think more based on my own work experience, and propose some questions and ideas in the weekly meeting. At the same time, I received an invitation from the ShenYu community to officially become a committer. In my opinion, becoming an Apache committer is not only an honor, but also a responsibility. Being trusted by the community, I need to contribute more to the community then. Becoming an Apache committer is not the end, but just a higher beginning.\\n\\n# My experience in Apahce ShenYu Community\\n\\nIn the process of participating in open source during this time, I have gained a lot, following are some of my experiences for your reference:\\n\\n- Start small: Contributions to the open source community are regardless of size. It\'s a contribution to the community no matter it\'s a major feature improvement or an one-line documentation error. Therefore,do not miss doing any good thing no matter how insignificant it looks. As long as it is a valuable contribution, it\'s welcomed by the community.\\n\\n- Active participation and continuous contribution:  Open source is a process of accumulating sand and building a tower. One time contribution may be limited, but as long as you participate in community activities actively, you can get promotion, no matter a proposal discussion in the email or the review code. You may not be as committed as you are in work, but as long as you make good use of your spare time and persist for a long time, you can still be successful.\\n\\n- Participate in email discussions and put forward ideas boldly: The biggest characteristics of open source communities are democracy, openness and transparency. Here, any ideas and suggestions will be fully valued. If you have a great idea, you just need to send an email and you can discuss it with everyone in the community. Your emails will always be answered. And all discussions are public, you can see people\'s discussions about your question. In many cases, the process of discussing about the problem is often more valuable than solving the problem itself."},{"id":"/Soul-gateway-release-milestone-version-2.3.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/Soul-gateway-release-milestone-version-2.3.0","source":"@site/news/Soul-gateway-release-milestone-version-2.3.0.md","title":"\u3010Soul gateway release milestone version 2.3.0\u3011New support for grpc, tars and sofa protocols!","description":"Soul gateway release milestone version 2.3.0 New support for grpc, tars and sofa protocols","date":"2020-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 5, 2020","tags":[{"label":"Apache ShenYu","permalink":"/news/tags/apache-shen-yu"}],"readingTime":3.365,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"xiaoyu"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"\u3010Soul gateway release milestone version 2.3.0\u3011New support for grpc, tars and sofa protocols!","author":"xiaoyu","description":"Soul gateway release milestone version 2.3.0 New support for grpc, tars and sofa protocols","categories":"Apache ShenYu","tags":["Apache ShenYu"],"date":"2020-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","cover":"/img/architecture/shenyu-framework.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"[The Open Source Path for Tech Veterans]","permalink":"/news/2022/02/28/Apache-ShenYu-Committer-"}},"content":"It\'s half a year since the last release.
