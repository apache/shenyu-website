## Description

* The grpc plugin is a plugin that converts the Http protocol into the grpc protocol.


## Plugin Setting

* Add related dependencies and enable plugin, please refer to: [Quick start with gRPC](../../quick-start/quick-start-grpc) .

* `gRPC` client access, please refer to: [gRPC Proxy](../../user-guide/grpc-proxy) .

* New fields and meanings of grpc plugin since `2.4.3`:

  * `threadpool`：There are two types of business thread pools, `cached` and `shared`. 
    
    `cached` is equivalent to the default thread pool officially provided by grpc; 
    
    `shared` thread pool, just as its name, `all proxy plugins` share a `shared` `Thread pool, the advantage of doing this is that it can reduce the number of thread pools, thereby reducing memory and improving resource utilization.


## Plugin Detail


After the client accesses the `Apache ShenYu` gateway, it will automatically register the selector and rule information. You can see it in PluginList -> rpc proxy -> grpc. For details about the selector and rule configuration, see [Selector And Rule Config](../../user-guide/admin-usage/selector-and-rule) .
