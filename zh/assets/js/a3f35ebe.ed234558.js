In the early stage, I used SpringCloud Gateway + Nacos Config Event to realize the dynamic routing of gateway by myself. Because there was no dashboard of Gateway at that time, it was very painful. My team made a dashboard based on Micro Enterprise, which has a lot of functionality and limitations. From then on, I started to pursue a good gateway. One day, I found ShenYu, and saw that ShenYu's overall architecture was in sharper contrast to SpringCloud Gateway. ShenYu outperforms Gateway in terms of overall architecture design, function design, plug-in design, etc. ShenYu can be said to be the next generation gateway product. After that, I started to have a certain understanding of Apache ShenYu from building environment to running example project, and then to read plug-in chain and data synchronization, SPI mechanism and other source code."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"start-submitting-pr",children:"Start submitting PR"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It was not until January 2022 that I started to submit my first PR, which was to fix a problem that caused null Pointers when the Admin module started the default load instance.
