In Apache Shenyu gateway, it not only realizes such traditional algorithms, but also makes smoother traffic processing for the entry of server nodes through detailed processing such as traffic warm-up, so as to obtain better overall stability. In this article, let's walk through how Apache Shenyu is designed and implemented this part of the function.</Translate>

As to rule data parsing processing, the SPI design increases the product's scalability. When appending new plugin, in most cases, the existing module is enough for rule data parsing , otherwise it can be rapidly carry out with tiny effort.</Translate>

When the system is attacked abnormally by a large number of traffic gathered in a short time; When there are a large number of lower priority request need to be slow down or else it will effect your high priority transactions; Or sometimes your system can not afford the regular traffic; in these scenarios, we need to start rate limiter component to protect our system, through rejection, wait, load shedding,etc, limit the requests to an acceptable quantities, or only certain domains (or services) requests can get through.</Translate>
